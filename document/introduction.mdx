## Versioning

The OpusClip API is versioned to ensure that changes to the API do not break existing integrations.

The latest version of the API is `v2`. Both `v1` and `v2` are supported, but it is recommended to use `v2` for new integrations.

You can switch versions by clicking in the top left corner of the page.
